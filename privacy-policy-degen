Privacy Policy — Degen
Last updated: October 17, 2025

Introduction

Degen (“we”, “our”, or “the App”) is committed to protecting your privacy and complying with applicable law. This Privacy Policy explains what information the Degen Android app (the “App”) collects, why, how it is used and shared, how long it is retained, and the rights you have.

Controller / Contact

Data controller (responsible party): Wayne Whitehead (individual)

Contact email: whiteheadwayne10@gmail.com

Postal address: 1 Vrede Ave, Bryanston, South Africa

Responsible person for privacy matters: Wayne Whitehead

The App is published by the developer of Degen. This policy URL should be published on the App store listing and in-app where appropriate.

Assumptions and legal scope

This policy is written to satisfy Google Play’s Data safety requirements (https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/topic/9877467) and to align with the primary developer jurisdiction, which we assume is South Africa (Protection of Personal Information Act, 2013 — POPIA). Where applicable, we also describe common data subject rights generally recognized under international standards (for example, GDPR-style rights) so users and app reviewers understand how requests are handled. If your primary jurisdiction differs, update the contact and legal references accordingly.

Summary — what we collect

The App uses Firebase and Google Mobile Ads (AdMob). In normal operation the App collects the following categories of data:

- Device or other identifiers (including Advertising ID) — collected by Google Mobile Ads and some Firebase SDKs.
- App activity and usage analytics (events, screens, engagement) — collected by Firebase Analytics.
- Diagnostics and performance data (crash reports, stack traces, performance traces, device model/OS) — collected by Firebase Crashlytics and Firebase Performance Monitoring.
- Advertising data (ad impressions, clicks) — collected by AdMob for ad delivery and measurement.

Important: the telemetry the App collects is not used by the App owner to identify a specific natural person in normal operation (no PII collected by default). The App does not provide any mechanism for users to upload or store personal content; there is nowhere in the App where users submit content that is stored by the service. If you believe personal information about you has been stored by other means, contact the data controller at the address above.

Why we collect this data (purposes)

We collect data for these purposes:

- App functionality: enabling basic app operations and feature behavior.
- Diagnostics & reliability: detecting and fixing crashes, monitoring performance.
- Product improvement & analytics: understanding feature usage and user flows.
- Advertising & monetization: serving ads, measuring impressions and clicks, and improving ad quality.

Legal basis (POPIA / reasonable basis statement)

- For operational diagnostics and analytics we rely on legitimate interest to maintain and improve the App and ensure a secure, functional product.
- For ads we rely on the mobile platform and advertising ecosystem (AdMob) which uses device/advertising identifiers for ad serving and measurement.
- The App does not collect user-supplied personal content through an upload mechanism; if such functionality is added in future it will be described in an updated policy.

No in‑App opt‑out for telemetry

Because the App does not collect user-identifying personal profiles in normal operation, there is no in‑app toggle to disable telemetry or analytics. Some telemetry is required for core functionality (crash reporting, app stability). Users may opt out of personalized advertising at the device level (Android Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization) or within their Google account. Opting out of personalized ads does not prevent the App from collecting non-identifying analytics/diagnostic telemetry needed for operation.

Data sharing and third parties

We use Google services (Firebase and AdMob) as processors. Data types described above are shared with Google for storage, analytics, crash reporting and ad delivery. Ad-related data may be shared with third-party advertising partners per AdMob’s operation and Google’s terms. We do not sell personal data.

Data retention

- Analytics and diagnostics: retained according to Firebase defaults and internal troubleshooting needs; typically retained for a limited period used to analyze stability and usage.
- Since the App does not store user-submitted content, there is no user-created content retention to report.

Security

We use industry-standard measures to protect data in transit and at rest (HTTPS/TLS in transit; encryption at rest per Firebase/Google defaults). No system is completely secure; avoid sharing highly sensitive personal information in the App UI or via other channels.

Children

The App is not intended for children under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have collected a child’s information, contact whiteheadwayne10@gmail.com to request removal.

User rights and requests

- Right to access / correct: Because telemetry is non-identifying, there is no per-user telemetry profile to retrieve or correct. The App does not provide a mechanism for users to upload or store content; therefore there is no stored user content tied to individuals that the controller can retrieve.
- Right to deletion: Per-user deletion of telemetry is not available because the App does not create user-identifiable telemetry records in normal operation.
- To make requests: contact Wayne Whitehead at whiteheadwayne10@gmail.com with a clear subject line ("Privacy request - Degen"). We may ask for minimal information to verify requests and will handle them in accordance with applicable law.

International transfers

Data may be stored and processed in the United States or other locations where Firebase and Google operate. By using the App you consent to such transfers.

Play Store / Data safety

This policy is written to match the Play Console Data safety requirements. When completing the Play Console Data safety form, declare collection and sharing in the categories above (Analytics, Diagnostics, Device identifiers, Advertising). Link to this policy in your Play listing.

Changes to this policy

We may update this policy. If material changes occur, we will post an update at this URL and update the "Last updated" date.
